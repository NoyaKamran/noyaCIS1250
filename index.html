  <h1>Importance of Software Design</h1>
 <p>
A very well designed software that I have personally been using for the majority of my life is Google. Since about 10 years ago, when I started using Google, it has always been extremely user friendly, fast, helpful and visually appealing. Back then, Google did look a little different with some different fonts and formatting, though it was basically the same as modern Google. The Google homepage allows you to search up anything you want easily, and Google offers many other softwares that allow you to do even more such as documents, calendars, photos, etc. The variety in apps as well as the simplicity allows every user to efficiently get tasks done. Qualities like this are very important to software design, as the whole premise of it is to ensure the design meets the needs of the users, allowing them to come to solutions as swiftly and easily as possible. Softwares that do not aid users easily are usually not people’s first choices. For a software to be as popular as Google, it is crucial to have a lot of thought behind the usability it can offer, which is why software design is so important. Good software designers ensure their softwares will have the traits it needs to solve all problems that come its way, leaving less worry for the user.
    <p>
The requirements gathering stage is crucial for an efficient and successful software development process. Within this process, it is the developers job to ask the stakeholders (e.g. Customers, Owners, etc.) what they expect out of the program. During the requirement gathering stage, you are to find out: what problem you are solving, who is using the product, as well as making sure you communicate all possible questions about the program. The questions should be specific in order to have detailed answers, which will lead to concise and clear requirements that are traceable, measurable, and testable. When you have the proper instructions about the program, following them will be easy and error free. If you have the wrong requirements in the beginning of your program, chances are the end will be based on a lot of assumptions you made yourself, and may be the complete opposite of what the client needed. Thus why the requirements gathering stage, i.e the first stage, is very important for the entire software development process.

Five user stories for Google’s software:
      <p>
  1. As a user of google, I want the search option of Google to be straightforward with symbols and labels for easy usage as it makes searching efficient.
  </p>
  2. As a user, I want all of the apps of Google to be easily accessible in one area, this would make it more efficient as I wouldnt be searching for each app.
  <p>
  3. As a user, I want my information such as personal details for my account, credit card information, and other things google can save if I allow it to, to be confidential and not able to be accessed by the public.
 </p>
  4. As a user, I want to be able to search up all my documents and such on the drive easily with a search option and a naming option on all the documents, so that my documents can be easily found allowing more time to do something else.
 <p>
  5. As a user, I want to have my searches save on some sort of history as it would make it simple to find something if I close the tab or my device shuts down my accident.

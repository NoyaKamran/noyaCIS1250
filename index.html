  <h1>Software Design</h1>
 <p>
     A very well designed software that I have personally been using for the majority of my life is Google. Since about 10 years ago, when I started using Google, it has always been extremely user friendly, fast, helpful and visually appealing. Back then, Google did look a little different with some different fonts and formatting, though it was basically the same as modern Google. The Google homepage allows you to search up anything you want easily, and Google offers many other softwares that allow you to do even more such as documents, calendars, photos, etc. The variety in apps as well as the simplicity allows every user to efficiently get tasks done. Qualities like this are very important to software design, as the whole premise of it is to ensure the design meets the needs of the users, allowing them to come to solutions as swiftly and easily as possible. Softwares that do not aid users easily are usually not peopleâ€™s first choices. For a software to be as popular as Google, it is crucial to have a lot of thought behind the usability it can offer, which is why software design is so important. Good software designers ensure their softwares will have the traits it needs to solve all problems that come its way, leaving less worry for the user.

  <h1>Importance of Software Design</h1>
 <p>
A very well designed software that I have personally been using for the majority of my life is Google. Since about 10 years ago, when I started using Google, it has always been extremely user friendly, fast, helpful and visually appealing. Back then, Google did look a little different with some different fonts and formatting, though it was basically the same as modern Google. The Google homepage allows you to search up anything you want easily, and Google offers many other softwares that allow you to do even more such as documents, calendars, photos, etc. The variety in apps as well as the simplicity allows every user to efficiently get tasks done. Qualities like this are very important to software design, as the whole premise of it is to ensure the design meets the needs of the users, allowing them to come to solutions as swiftly and easily as possible. Softwares that do not aid users easily are usually not people’s first choices. For a software to be as popular as Google, it is crucial to have a lot of thought behind the usability it can offer, which is why software design is so important. Good software designers ensure their softwares will have the traits it needs to solve all problems that come its way, leaving less worry for the user.
    <p>
The requirements gathering stage is crucial for an efficient and successful software development process. Within this process, it is the developers job to ask the stakeholders (e.g. Customers, Owners, etc.) what they expect out of the program. During the requirement gathering stage, you are to find out: what problem you are solving, who is using the product, as well as making sure you communicate all possible questions about the program. The questions should be specific in order to have detailed answers, which will lead to concise and clear requirements that are traceable, measurable, and testable. When you have the proper instructions about the program, following them will be easy and error free. If you have the wrong requirements in the beginning of your program, chances are the end will be based on a lot of assumptions you made yourself, and may be the complete opposite of what the client needed. Thus why the requirements gathering stage, i.e the first stage, is very important for the entire software development process.

Five user stories for Google’s software:
      <p>
  1. As a user of google, I want the search option of Google to be straightforward with symbols and labels for easy usage as it makes searching efficient.
  </p>
  2. As a user, I want all of the apps of Google to be easily accessible in one area, this would make it more efficient as I wouldnt be searching for each app.
  <p>
  3. As a user, I want my information such as personal details for my account, credit card information, and other things google can save if I allow it to, to be confidential and not able to be accessed by the public.
 </p>
  4. As a user, I want to be able to search up all my documents and such on the drive easily with a search option and a naming option on all the documents, so that my documents can be easily found allowing more time to do something else.
 <p>
  5. As a user, I want to have my searches save on some sort of history as it would make it simple to find something if I close the tab or my device shuts down my accident.

The software product mentioned in writing assignment 1 was the Google software. Someone who would be a potential user of this software could be Sarah. Sarah is 29, working as a marketing specialist with a household income of $65,000. She works in Toronto, and her tech savviness is decently high. She uses her laptop, smartphone(which is an android) and her tablet. Her styles consist of Modernity, and minimalism. Her dimensions consist of: Efficiency, as it is the number one thing to many aspects of her life, she adapts quickly to technologies, and prefers using tools that can easily sync with other devices. As for motivations: <b>Personal growth</b>: she relies on Google's tools to get together her work, and meet her deadlines. <b>Simplicity</b>: she needs the ease of Google apps to allow her to focus on her work rather than understanding multiple softwares. <b>Organization</b>: with work, social events and other projects, she needs Googles calendar and Keep notes app to allow her to stay organized. As for her personal life: she lives alone in downtown Toronto, as this is the nearest area to her work. Google is used for her many searches for her hobbies like cooking(for recipes), as well as her photos of friends, family and the meals she makes for them.

Communication in software design is crucial for every team member to stay on the same page. It ensures an efficient and collaborative process that meets product goals. Clear communication reduces misunderstandings and connects the designers, developers, and stakeholders allowing everyone to share a unified vision. Key elements of communication include clarity, constructive feedback, and thorough documentation. Clarity assures that team members will fully understand requirements, questions, and objectives without misinterpretation. Clear instructions reduce hassle and save time by avoiding miscommunication. Constructive feedback lets team members improve their plans and designs as the product progresses. Stakeholders making sure they are actively following the progression while criticizing anything unideal will allow mistakes to be caught early. Documentation of progress will allow everyone to have a point of reference to keep up with everything. If there is a written explanation of the project, the team can have less reliance on verbal  explanations, which can allow less ambiguity in the plan. These three elements foster collaboration, clear ideas, and informed progress tracking. When teams work this smoothly, software is released faster, and the result is a product that accurately meets stakeholders' needs.

The principle chosen was the 10th: simplicity. Simplicity in software design focuses on minimizing complexity by only showing what is necessary. It involves coming up with straightforward solutions that are easy to understand, maintain and adapt. This principle is needed in software design as it enhances usability, lowers the time to develop the software, and improves the system's reliability, making it easier to meet the user's needs better. An example of simplicity in real life is Google search. Its interface only has a search bar and a button. Only having the important parts of the software strips away the distractions and allows users to focus on only their task of searching efficiently. As this design was one of the first to have such an ease of use, along with Google as a platform, it has helped Google become the leading search engine. Another example is the design of IKEA furniture manuals. The steps are all drawn to be clear and concise visuals with minimal text. This lets the users assemble their furniture without any confusion. This focus on simplicity reduces frustration and errors, bettering the customer experience. For software and any sort of user experience, not having a simple design can overwhelm users and delay development. Keeping things simple lets developers and designers create systems that are not only functional but also adaptable to future needs.
